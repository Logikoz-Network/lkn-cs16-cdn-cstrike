For the map!

The map take me 3-4 mouths maybe, I'm not sure, but I work a lot of on this map!
The map is re-textured, new bases created and a lot of new things. The map is not very
big, it's easy to play on this map. I make a lot of changes,  I think that the map for me 
is better than before, but this is my apinion! On the map there is only one hide place and one
place which is locked and one place with a teleport. The map is made for christmas, but with a little late!

Ideas!

Wood fixing idea by UltraS^ (resizing the wood)!
Glock18 - Idea for bringing the map alive!
others things are ideas by me!

History

Christmas bad side and good side, in the good side they put add things which
make the christmas awesome, in the bad side they put the horrible things which 
makes the christmas horrible and scary! In 1912, maybe a group of 6-7 scientists, 
go to explore the bad side and up to 1951 nobody knows what happen on them. 
In 1951, one old map about 70 or 80 years old tell that they aren't alive, they have been
locked in a cage in RouseVill in one camp this camp has been locked. At 1971 year, 
from one camp their apear others camps, nobody knows how this happen! One advice 
don't go in rousevill this place is very scary!

What's new?

- Deleted the kz and made the two glasses breakable
- I made to not go outside the map
- I made the three buttons in the hide place to be fake
